This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Future Features i want to add in this project
1. Branding Customization like adding brand logo and colors and through AI we'll create a custom theme for the form based on brand colors.

2. Adding APIs for section templates so admin or other people can add templates for a better library of templates.

3. When user selects a template, the user can preview the template in their own brand colors and logo. (Theme will automatically changed by AI based on brand colors and logo).
